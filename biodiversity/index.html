        <p>Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from
            alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversity—an estimated 250,000 species—of which
            only 5% have been described—occur in Australia. Because of the continent's great age, extremely
            variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About
            85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish
            are endemic. Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the
            world.Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral
            cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by
            European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable
            and endangered native species.Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries.</p>
